# Paper-Trading Engine

A disciplined, rule-based automation layer that trades the **ai4trade.ai
simulated account** ($100k of paper capital, real market prices). It pulls
market intelligence, scores candidates on transparent rules, places paper
trades, and tracks every position on a P&L scorecard.

> **This package never touches real money.** Live trading goes through the
> Robinhood MCP, which keeps a human confirmation gate on every order. The
> intent is to prove a strategy here first, then mirror only what works.

## Setup

The engine authenticates with an ai4trade bearer token, read from
`AI4TRADE_TOKEN` (env) or the git-ignored `.env.secrets` at the repo root.

```bash
pip install -r service/requirements.txt   # provides `requests`
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m trader.cli status              # scorecard: equity, cash, positions, P&L
python -m trader.cli scan                # rank candidates + show why each passed/failed
python -m trader.cli events fed rate     # live Polymarket odds for a topic (no API key)
python -m trader.cli run                 # DRY-RUN: print the buys it would place
python -m trader.cli run --execute       # place those paper trades (simulated $)
python -m trader.cli loop --execute      # autonomous loop: exits + entries on an interval
python -m trader.cli backtest AMD NVDA   # backtest the strategy logic over real history
python -m trader.cli optimize            # sweep exit strategies, rank by risk-adjusted return
python -m trader.cli social NVDA         # social-media research status + run (read-only)
```

## Social-media research (read-only — never posting)

`social` reports which platforms are configured and, when a local
last30days-skill install is available (`LAST30DAYS_DIR`), researches a topic
across them. It is strictly for *signal*; nothing is ever published.

Activate platforms by adding keys to `.env.secrets`:

| Platform | Key(s) |
|----------|--------|
| Reddit + TikTok + Instagram | `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` (one key, three platforms) |
| X / Twitter | `XAI_API_KEY` (or `AUTH_TOKEN`+`CT0` cookies) |
| Bluesky | `BSKY_HANDLE` + `BSKY_APP_PASSWORD` |
| Truth Social | `TRUTHSOCIAL_TOKEN` |
| Web search | `BRAVE_API_KEY` / `EXA_API_KEY` / `PARALLEL_API_KEY` |
| Synthesis | `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

YouTube, Hacker News, and Polymarket need no key. **LinkedIn and Facebook are
not supported** by the research engine.

## Backtesting

`backtest` replays a faithful proxy of the strategy (stacked bullish MAs +
controlled momentum, stop −8% / target +15%) over real daily closes and
reports trades, win rate, total vs buy-and-hold return, and max drawdown.

`optimize` sweeps exit strategies (fixed target, trend-hold, trailing stops)
across the saved universe and ranks them by return-over-drawdown. The current
default — a **10% trailing stop** — won that sweep (higher return and lower
drawdown than a fixed target) and is what the live engine's exit management
uses. Note: in a strong bull sample no variant beats raw buy-and-hold on
absolute return; the edge is drawdown control, which matters most in choppy or
falling markets.

History lives in `trader/state/history/<SYMBOL>.json` (git-ignored). Regenerate
it by pulling daily bars from the Robinhood MCP (`get_equity_historicals`,
`interval=day`) and writing `{symbol, bars:[{t, c}]}` per symbol. The live
ai4trade signal can't be replayed historically, so this validates the rules'
*logic*, not the exact live signal — a sanity check, not a return promise.

## Autonomous loop

`loop` runs the full cycle — pull macro context, manage exits (sell on
stop/target), evaluate new entries — on a fixed interval until stopped.

```bash
python -m trader.cli loop --execute --interval 900 --daily-cap 5
```

Guardrails (so an unattended run can't misbehave):

- **Kill switch** — `touch trader/state/STOP` halts it before the next cycle.
- **Daily entry cap** — `--daily-cap` limits new buys per UTC day; once hit,
  the loop manages exits only.
- **Bounded run** — `--max-cycles N` stops after N cycles (0 = until killed).

> The loop trades **only the simulated account**. Real-money and options
> execution are deliberately not wired here — those stay behind the Robinhood
> MCP, which confirms every order with a human. The paper platform also has no
> options endpoint; options live only on the real account.

## How decisions are made

`trader/strategy.py` holds a `StrategyConfig` with explicit, tunable rules:

- platform signal must be a **buy** with score ≥ `min_signal_score`
- trend must be bullish, with at least `min_room_to_resistance_pct` upside to
  resistance, and not already extended past `max_return_5d_pct` over 5 days
- stand down entirely when the macro regime reads **bearish**
- size each new position at `position_pct_of_cash` of cash, cap at
  `max_positions` concurrent holdings
- every accepted candidate gets a derived **stop** (structural support, else
  −8%) and **target** (resistance, else +15%)

Every accept/reject prints its reasons, so the logic is auditable rather than a
black box. This is a baseline to backtest and tune — not a finished alpha.
